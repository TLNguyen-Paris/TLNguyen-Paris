# Hi there, i'm Thanh Long Nguyen 👋

I'm a french full-stack developer mainly focused on javascript. I'm currently at Webforce3 (a web developer bootcamp) for learning purposes, self development and internship possibilities. I'm either looking for an internship or a full-time job if the learning curve and the working environment are humanly and technically suitable.
